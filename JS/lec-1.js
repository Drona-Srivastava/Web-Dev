//Variables
// JS is dynamic typing language -> a variable type can be changed in runtime 
// other is static typing where variable type can not be changed like in C/C++ once declared an int it can not be changed to float
//var is a container in which all types are stored no need to specify which type it is
let a = 67 // var in place of let would work the same
console.log(a)
a = "Drona"
console.log(a) 
//hence we do not need to specify the type and can be changed in runtime
const b = 90
console.log(b)
//b = 34 can not be changes since we used cont (constant)
//console.log(b)

// let keyword lets us create local variable with same name whereas var does not allow us to use same name for another local variable if we try to do so the global variable value will be changes
